			<aside class="blog--intro">"You are not your job, you’re not how much money you have in the bank. You are not the car you drive. You’re not the contents of your wallet. You are not your fucking khakis. You are all singing, all dancing crap of the world.” 
			<span class="blog--subheader"> — Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club</span> </aside>

			<p>This past weekend, I attended a cooking class with my Partner and a group of other Bay Area couples. The instructor asked us to introduce ourselves to the group and state which tech company we worked for. I’m accustomed to presenting my profession or interests, but I have never been asked to introduce myself to a group of strangers by defining where I worked. Even at a cooking class on a Saturday night, I am my job. The other couples seemed eager and almost happy to have the opportunity to go around the room and compare their jobs. I felt like I was the only crazy one who thought introducing myself by my company was a little odd. 

			<p>This event bugged me for a few reasons: 1) There seems to be a growing trend in the tech industry that links your identity to your company, and 2) a conflation of work and personal life. This change is different from self-identifying with your career or job, by combing your sense of self with your company seems, to me, to be a new trend. 

			<p>Full disclaimer here: I currently work in tech and have worked in tech my entire career. I have definitely experienced the rise and fall of companies and have let those experiences influence my sense of personal success. Decoupling my work and my identity is a continuous self-improvement project.

			<p>Why I find this conflation to be a problem is that there are lot of external factors that are out of our control. If your company fails or your defined role doesn’t go as planned, it can put unnecessary pressure on your identity as an person. As Rohan Gunatillake’s outlined in his recent talk You Are Not Your Work on 99U, by not developing a strong internal compass outside of your tech company, then it can cause you to feel a sense of failure based on the ups and owns of tech job. As Rohan states, decoupling yourself and your work is extremely important:
			

			<aside class="blog--intro">“And the fourth one, the fourth fear, this fear of being a failure– not fear of failure– fear of being a failure. And the practice– this is the big one, this is the hard one, this is the big guy, I guess– decoupling self and work. Because if I am my work, if I am my product and my product fails, then I have failed. If I fully identify with my product, and then it falls over, then just sort of classic logic, I have fallen over. And that’s a really dangerous place to be in a volatile world where attention is all over the place and you don’t know what’s going to stick and what’s not going to stick.”</aside>

			<p>Like a lot of designers in the Bay Area, I am very guilty of self-identifying by my career. Design and being a designer defines who I am and how I view the world. For me it is much more than a day job and goes beyond any 9-to-5 schedule. I often feel like critiques of things I’ve created are critiques of me, which isn’t the case. 

			<p>Blending your identity with your company can quickly lead to burnout and anxiety. We also run the risk of viewing one another as cogs in the organization instead of honoring our humanity.

			<p>When it comes to being successful in the modern relationship with work, the true challenge comes with building a strong foundation. Attaching your foundation to the success and failures of a company is dependent on external factors outside of your control. It’s extremely important to find joy and acceptance no matter what your paystub says.
